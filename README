This is a little project I hacked up on a Friday afternoon at Stanford.
I needed a mobile site to read The Daily from on my BlackBerry. I promise
I would never use $GLOBALS unless it was for a quick hack job, which this
 precisely was. Anyways, I'm sure there are still some TODOs left in the 
code that I never got around to, but the main functionality worked which 
is all I cared about. ENJOY!
